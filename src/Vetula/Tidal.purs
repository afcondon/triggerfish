-- | `Vetula.Tidal` — render a progression (a path's chords, with their chosen
-- | voicings) as TidalCycles source, so a sequence built by ear in Vetula can be
-- | preserved and dropped into a live-coding cell. We emit the *voiced* notes
-- | (bass + uppers, via `playNotes`) as explicit note lists rather than chord
-- | names, so the exact voicing the user crafted in the Revoice tab survives the
-- | round trip — chord-name shorthand (`c'maj7`) would throw the voicing away.

-- | A MIDI note as a Tidal-safe note name with octave (e.g. 60 → "c5", 61 →
-- | "cs5"). Tidal's note-name octave convention matches `midi `div` 12` (c5 = 0 =
-- | MIDI 60). Accidentals follow the display spelling but in `s`/`f` form, since
-- | Tidal's parser won't take "♯"/"♭".

-- | The whole progression as a Tidal source block: a header comment naming the
-- | key and the chords, then a `note "<…>"` pattern (one chord per cycle — the
-- | natural reading of a progression), with the all-in-one-cycle form offered as
-- | a commented alternative.

-- | Pull the chord note-lists out of a pasted Tidal source: drop comment lines
-- | (so the commented all-in-one-cycle alt is ignored), then extract every
-- | `[a,b,c]` group from the remaining text and parse each note token to MIDI.
-- | Lenient — unparseable tokens drop out, empty groups are filtered — so a
-- | half-typed paste never throws.
