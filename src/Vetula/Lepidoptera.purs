-- | `Vetula.Lepidoptera` — the Perform surface as one transferable document.
-- |
-- | Where `Vetula.Tidal` serialises a single *progression* (one caught-chord path
-- | as `note "<…>"`), this serialises the whole **Perform surface**: the set of
-- | parallel voices, each a source-reference + a mini-notation head + a transform
-- | stack + a terminal. That makes a live Perform configuration a named, saveable
-- | *scene* — the Amphora-storable "the file is the music" — and the atom a future
-- | macro/arrangement layer sequences (verse / chorus / head-fugue).
-- |
-- | The document shape (Tier 2 of the convergence — see the Lepidoptera memory):
-- |
-- |   -- vetula perform · C major · 3 voices
-- |   source A "<[c5,e5,g5] [a4,c5,e5] [d5,f5,a5] [g4,b4,d5]>"
-- |   source B "<[c5,e5,g5,b5,d6] …>"
-- |   ch1 A "0 1 2 3" # voice open # strum 14
-- |   ch2 B "0 1 2 3" # arpup 4 # every 4
-- |   ch5 - "" # transpose 12 # out rig
-- |
-- | Two principles from the design conversation are baked in:
-- |
-- |   * **Sources are plural and named; sharing is a coincidence of reference.**
-- |     A voice names a source; two voices that name the same one share harmony,
-- |     and re-harmonising = editing one table entry. Distinct/inline sources give
-- |     the "different chords per voice" cases (plain vs substitution sibling,
-- |     different keys). "Set all at once" is a repoint, never a baseline share.
-- |   * **One grammar across the ecosystem.** The `"head" # verb arg` lane is
-- |     parsed by `Triggerfish.Macro.parseLane` verbatim (the arrangement layer's
-- |     grammar). Vetula owns only the *vocabulary* — the `(verb,arg) -> PerfFx`
-- |     table — which is the right seam. This forced the (b)-tasteful choice:
-- |     arp's direction fuses into the verb (`arpup`/`arpdown`/`arpupdown`) so
-- |     every layer is a single-arg mod, and `every N` is a trailing mod that
-- |     binds to the preceding layer. `out <term>` / `mute` ride the same grammar.
-- |
-- | Total + lenient (Selene `Source.purs` discipline): unknown mods drop, partial
-- | ones fall back to defaults, values clamp to the chip-nudge ranges. Aim:
-- |   parsePerform (performSource doc) == doc  (modulo trim + source-name canon).
-- |
-- | NOTE (follow-up): this imports the Perform types from `Vetula.App`. Wiring a
-- | save button *into* App will need App to import this — a cycle — so first
-- | extract the pure Perform types (PerfFx/Layer/PerfTerm/…) into a shared module.
-- | Deferred deliberately; tonight is additive and leaves App untouched.
