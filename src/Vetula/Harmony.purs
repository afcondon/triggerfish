-- | `Vetula.Harmony` — the chord model, the generation families, and the
-- | spatial layout.
-- |
-- | A `ChordNode` is a concrete chord on the surface. The surface starts as the
-- | McMullen palette and GROWS: hover a chord and a generation family
-- | (`revoicings` / `inversions` / `suspensions` / `extensions`) spawns its
-- | children. `place` positions every node over an imaginary piano keyboard:
-- | x = the chord's ROOT on the keys, y = how far outside the chosen scale it
-- | is (in-scale chords hover just above the keys; outside chords float higher).
-- | Collision then beeswarms the chords sharing a key.
