-- | macro-tidal — the arrangement layer.
-- |
-- | Where the instruments each play ONE saved form at a time, the macro layer
-- | SEQUENCES those forms over macro-time AND transforms them in place. A lane
-- | is a mini-notation string whose atoms are *form names* (Amphora labels),
-- | each optionally carrying a stack of `#`-modifiers:
-- |
-- |   "contemplative" # scale <"F# lydian dominant" "G major">
-- |   "bopping along" ~ <midnight drift>
-- |
-- | The shell resolves each name to a saved setup, loads it into the instrument
-- | at a bar-quantized step boundary, and applies the resolved modifiers. This
-- | unifies two ideas: sequencing forms (the arrangement) and transforming them
-- | (the workbench transforms) — a transform is just a modifier on a lane atom.
-- |
-- | Subset (Slice: transforms):
-- |
-- |   * space-separated STEPS divide the macro-cycle equally
-- |   * a form name with spaces is double-quoted ("bopping along")
-- |   * `~` is a rest — the instrument falls silent for that step
-- |   * `<a b c>` alternates a form (or a modifier ARG) once per macro-CYCLE
-- |   * `# verb arg` attaches a transform; the arg may itself be `<…>`
-- |
-- | The language is DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC: it yields `(verb, arg)` string pairs and
-- | does not know what `scale`/`fast`/`bass` mean — the shell interprets each
-- | verb for the target instrument. Weights (`@`), replication (`*`) and the
-- | other lanes come later. The parser is one-level (no nested `<>`).
