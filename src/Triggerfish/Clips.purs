-- | `Triggerfish.Clips` — the shared MIDI clip library types (recording axis #27,
-- | see docs/DESIGN-midi-clip-library.md). A leaf module (Prelude + Data only) so
-- | every capturing machine (Odonus, Vetula, …) and the shared store can depend on
-- | ONE definition of a captured clip without an import cycle.
-- |
-- | Principle: STORE EVERYTHING, FLATTEN LATE. A `MidiClip` keeps the full captured
-- | events — pitch, source channel (`headIdx`), velocity, gate, absolute onset
-- | micros — and bakes in NO tempo, key, or quantization. Every lossy projection
-- | (flatten-to-chord, drop-velocity, re-tempo) happens at PLAYBACK, so future
-- | fidelity (honour velocity, per-phrase rate) needs no re-capture.

-- | One emitted note in a scrolling monitor / logbook / clip. `fireUnixMicros` is
-- | the wall-clock instant it sounded (rebased to [0, lenMicros) inside a clip);
-- | `headIdx` is the source voice/channel it came from (0-based), preserved so a
-- | multi-channel recording keeps its channel structure. `vel`/`gateMs` carry the
-- | dynamics + note length so a faithful re-emit is possible. Moved here from
-- | `Odonus.Grid.Types` (which now re-exports it) so it's the one shared definition.

-- | A captured MIDI clip in the shared library. CORE fields are always present; the
-- | rest is optional/defaulted metadata for the future clip browser — populated
-- | cheaply at capture, all forward-compatible so the schema doesn't churn. Naming
-- | clips is a mug's game (you won't remember what "clip 7" was), so the browser is
-- | meant to work by tags + computed features (density, pitch range, voice count —
-- | all DERIVABLE from `events`, hence not stored), not by name.
