-- | Triggerfish.Selene.Model — the state of the Selene polysignal rack.
-- |
-- | Selene is a list of **destinations**. A destination is a group of eight
-- | related signals (an "octo" bank of one generator kind) bound to a physical
-- | **target** — eight ES-9 buses, eight ES-5 gates, an ESX-8CV block, an FH-2
-- | bank, or a MIDI channel. You add destinations in groups of eight and
-- | configure each in place; there is no global bank selector. The relation
-- | between a destination's eight slots is the musical idea (a phase-spread LFO
-- | choir, a metric fan of clocks, eight Euclidean rings, a held chord).
-- |
-- | Slot field names are copied verbatim from `Tidal.Selene` (purerl-tidal) so
-- | this ports onto the BEAM cell + the es9-daemon `apply-polysignal` wire
-- | shape. All five families are exposed, polyenv included (2026-08-08).

-- | POLYCLOCK: a tempo-locked gate train. `base` / `multiplier` set the
-- | division (beats-per-pulse = base-beats / multiplier), `pulseWidth` the
-- | duty %, `phase` a degrees offset. Rate rides the Link tempo at playback.
type ClockSlot =
  { base :: ClockBase
  , multiplier :: Int
  , pulseWidth :: Int
  , phase :: Int
  }

-- | POLYEUCLID: a Euclidean gate — `beats` pulses spread over `steps`, clocked
-- | at `rate` subdivisions/beat. `accentRate` is an FH-2 feature ES-9 drops.
type EuclidSlot =
  { beats :: Int
  , steps :: Int
  , rate :: Int
  , accentRate :: Int
  }

-- | POLYPRESETNOTE: a static V/oct pitch, one held MIDI note per slot.
type PresetNoteSlot =
  { note :: Int
  }

-- | POLYENV: one MCV-bound ADSR per slot, fired by a MIDI note on the slot's own
-- | channel (envelope N listens on channel N+1 — channels 1..8). Envelope-only:
-- | the MCV emits no gate and no pitch CV, so a note that triggers it has to
-- | carry pitch on a DIFFERENT MCV if you want one.
-- |
-- | Continuous output, so CV-capable banks only — `BankGt` is rejected by the
-- | layout solver, and the daemon answers `capability mismatch` if you try.
-- |
-- | **These fields are exactly the wire contract, not the whole slot.** The
-- | daemon's `decodeEnvSlot` calls `assertKnownKeys`, which REJECTS an unknown
-- | field outright, so this record matches its allow-list rather than the fuller
-- | `PolyEnv.Slot` on the far side.
-- |
-- | `velDepth` is the one that earns its place: bipolar, 64 = no effect, and it
-- | is how MIDI velocity scales the envelope. **It is the only per-note
-- | expression this path can offer** — the shape is config and cannot change per
-- | note — so with it a melodic line has dynamics, and without it every note
-- | comes out identical. Odonus already carries a per-cell velocity, so this
-- | costs no new UI there. (Note it varies the envelope's DEPTH, not its time:
-- | you get loud-and-quiet, not long-and-short.)
-- |
-- | `timeRange` is the firmware's 200ms…50s bucket, and is NOT the wire's
-- | `range`, which is the output VOLTAGE range. Per-slot, so the eight envelopes
-- | can sit at different time scales — per voice, still not per note.
-- |
-- | All three of `depth` / `velDepth` / `timeRange` were plumbed to the hardware
-- | and merely unreachable over the wire until 2026-08-08; `FH2.PolyBank` now
-- | accepts them.
-- |
-- | Omitting per-slot output `range` here deliberately: the destination's
-- | `outputRange` already covers it, and a second place to set the same thing is
-- | the kind of duplication this codebase has spent the week removing.

-- | The base an envelope line is READ ONTO and WRITTEN AGAINST — one value, so
-- | the two can't disagree.
-- |
-- | They did. `envLine` elided a field when it matched the musical default
-- | (depth 127, vel 96), while `parseEnv` folded onto the SILENT slot (depth 0,
-- | vel 64). So a full-depth velocity-sensitive envelope printed as bare ADSR
-- | and came back with depth 0 — an envelope that fires and moves nothing — and
-- | with velocity response switched off. Both of the things the FH-2 envelope
-- | work is about, lost on the first round-trip through the text surface, which
-- | is the surface Selene edits through.
-- |
-- | Distinct from `silentEnv` in Source.purs, which is what a MUTED row means:
-- | there, depth 0 is the point. An envelope has no true "off" (depth is not on
-- | the wire), so "muted" has to be spelled as "moves nothing".

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | A destination: a typed eight-slot bank bound to a physical target, with an

-- |
-- | `Nothing` means "don't pin one — let the FH-2 daemon's per-family policy
-- | decide", and that is the normal case. The policy already exists in exactly
-- | one place (`FH2.PolyBank.familyDefaultRange`: gate families and polyenv are
-- | unipolar +5V, LFO and random stay bipolar), so restating it here would be a
-- | second copy to drift.
-- |
-- | It used to be a required field hardcoded to `Bipolar5V` at all five
-- | construction sites, which silently OVERRODE that policy — the field is only
-- | consulted when present. Harmless while the only FH-2 destination was an LFO
-- | (bipolar is right for an LFO) and invisible on ES-9 targets (the range is an
-- | FH-2 jack setting). Envelopes were the first family to expose it: they came
-- | up bipolar and idled at -5V, which is the "all-blue" reading on the FH-2's
-- | display, and the same symptom fh2-config recorded on-rig on 2026-05-13.

-- | `Just r` is the user pinning it deliberately — e.g. `env fh2_0 unipolar8v`
-- | for more envelope headroom than the +5V default.
